Java Calculator
===============

This is an improved rewrite of a Java calculator program that I've
originally written at University of Minnesota CyberCamp some time in
the year 2006.  The original version's GUI was written entirely using
Java AWT, i.e. pixel coordinates were used to specify fixed widget
positions.  This version uses Java Swing.  Operator precedence is not
supported.

Major Dependencies
==================

If you get these wrong, you'll have a heck of a time to figure out how
to run the software.  Get these right, and any remaining dependency
conflicts will be simple to resolve.
