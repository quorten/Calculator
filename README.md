Java Calculator
===============

This is an improved rewrite of a Java calculator program that I've
originally written at University of Minnesota CyberCamp some time in
the year 2006.  The original version's GUI was written entirely using
Java AWT, i.e. pixel coordinates were used to specify fixed widget
positions.  This version uses Java Swing.  Operator precedence is not
supported.
